My first php project that does the following
-> Collects data from users using form
-> Updates the data into a table named 'profile' in a database named 'student profile'
-> Displays a selected data of all registered users in the data page
-> A view profile button that displays the whole data of the selected user
-> An Edit button to change the data of a registered user
-> An update button to update the data on the database and reflects in the data page
